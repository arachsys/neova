Configuration tool for Enhancia Neova ring controller
=====================================================

ringctl is a command-line script to configure an Enhancia Neova MIDI ring
controller, covering the same functions as the graphical Neova Dashboard
application.

Connected by USB to a Linux, BSD or macOS host, the Neova hub will register
as both a standard ACM serial port and a class-compliant MIDI port.

Ring gestures are converted to pitch bend and controller messages which are
received by the host or instrument on the USB MIDI port. Meanwhile, the USB
serial port streams direct sensor and battery information, and it is also
used for configuration and firmware upgrades.


Installation and testing
------------------------

The script requires Python 3.8 or later. Run in situ with 'python3 ringctl'
or 'python ringctl'. To install, ensure the #! interpreter at the top of the
script is right for your system, then copy it into a directory on your path.

On Linux, the serial device looks like /dev/ttyACM0, whereas on BSD it is of
the form /dev/cuaU0. Shell tab completion is useful on macOS, which opts for
long, ugly names like /dev/cu.usbmodem0000000000001.

Test ringctl by running it with just the device as a single argument. It
should detect the hub and report the configuration to stdout. For example:

  $ ringctl /dev/ttyACM0
  hub 1.1
  ring 1.1
  bank 1

  1 channel 1
  1 1 1 vibrato 50.0 40.2
  1 2 1 bend -40.2 -20.0 20.0 40.2
  1 3 1 tilt 1 0 127 0.0 62.1
  1 4 1 roll 2 0 127 0.0 62.1

  2 channel 1
  2 1 1 vibrato 50.0 40.2
  2 2 1 bend -40.2 -20.0 20.0 40.2
  2 3 1 tilt 1 0 127 0.0 62.1
  2 4 1 roll 2 0 127 0.0 62.1

  3 channel 1
  3 1 1 vibrato 50.0 40.2
  3 2 1 bend -40.2 -20.0 20.0 40.2
  3 3 1 tilt 1 0 127 0.0 62.1
  3 4 1 roll 2 0 127 0.0 62.1

  4 channel 1
  4 1 1 vibrato 50.0 40.2
  4 2 1 bend -40.2 -20.0 20.0 40.2
  4 3 1 tilt 1 0 127 0.0 62.1
  4 4 1 roll 2 0 127 0.0 62.1

Common errors include 'Permission denied' if you lack read-write access to
the device, and 'Not a tty' or hanging if you use the wrong device.

When the Neova Dashboard is installed on macOS, a background daemon runs
continuously even when the application is not running. This steals output
from the hub and will prevent ringctl from working. The daemon also eats
battery by spinning in a short-timeout poll() loop, whether or not a hub is
connected. Hopefully the manufacturer will eliminate it in a future release.

Showing current settings
------------------------

Neova has four gesture banks which can be selected using the A, B, C, D
buttons while the shift button is held. Each of these has four slots which
can be independently configured with any of the available gestures and
toggled on/off with the A, B, C, D buttons.

To show the hub/ring versions and the gestures configured in each BANK SLOT
pair, use

  ringctl DEVICE

or

  ringctl DEVICE show

The output format for each bank and slot is the same as is expected by the
configuration commands described below:

  BANK channel CHANNEL
  BANK SLOT ENABLE vibrato GAIN THRESHOLD
  BANK SLOT ENABLE bend LMIN LMAX RMIN RMAX
  BANK SLOT ENABLE tilt CONTROL LOW HIGH MIN MAX
  BANK SLOT ENABLE roll CONTROL LOW HIGH MIN MAX

Slots with no gesture configured are omitted from the listing.


Selecting a gesture bank
------------------------

To select a gesture bank from 1 to 4, use

  ringctl DEVICE bank BANK

or change it using the hub buttons. The MIDI output will now correspond to
the gestures in the enabled slots of this bank.


Configuring the output MIDI channel
-----------------------------------

To configure the output MIDI channel for a bank, use

  ringctl DEVICE BANK channel CHANNEL

for CHANNEL between 1 and 16.


Configuring vibrato
-------------------

Vibrato is activated by shaking your hand left to right. The speed and
intensity of the motion will be reflected in the frequency and depth of an
output pitch bend oscillation. To configure this gesture in a slot, use

  ringctl DEVICE BANK SLOT ENABLE vibrato GAIN THRESHOLD

ENABLE sets the initial state of the gesture: 0 if disabled or 1 if enabled.
It can later be toggled on and off with the corresponding hub button, and
when enabled, the slot LED will glow pink to indicate vibrato is active.

GAIN and THRESHOLD are percentages from 0.0 to 100.0. Higher GAIN deepens
the pitch oscillation for a given finger motion, and higher THRESHOLD
increases the degree of motion required before the gesture activates.

These parameters are reported by 'ringctl DEVICE show' in the same order and
format as required by this command.


Configuring pitch bend
----------------------

Pitch bend is activated by rolling your hand to the left to bend down or to
the right to bend up. The pitch deflection increases with the angle of roll.
To configure this gesture in a slot, use

  ringctl DEVICE BANK SLOT ENABLE bend LMIN LMAX RMIN RMAX

ENABLE sets the initial state of the gesture: 0 if disabled or 1 if enabled.
It can later be toggled on and off with the corresponding hub button, and
when enabled, the slot LED will glow purple to indicate bend is active.

LMIN, LMAX, RMIN and RMAX are angles from -100.0 degrees to +100.0 degrees,
such that LMIN < LMAX < RMIN < RMAX, where a level hand position corresponds
to 0.0 degrees. As leftward roll reaches LMAX, pitch starts to bend down,
with full deflection at LMIN. Similarly, as rightward roll reaches RMIN,
pitch starts to bend up, with full deflection at RMAX.


Configuring tilt
----------------

Tilt is activated by tipping your hand to point upwards or downwards. The
controller or pitch deflection varies with the angle of tilt. To configure
this gesture in a slot, use

  ringctl DEVICE BANK SLOT ENABLE tilt CONTROL LOW HIGH MIN MAX

ENABLE sets the initial state of the gesture: 0 if disabled or 1 if enabled.
It can later be toggled on and off with the corresponding hub button, and
when enabled, the slot LED will glow yellow to indicate tilt is active.

CONTROL is the MIDI controller number (0-127) to generate, or -1 for pitch
bend. Controller output is constrained to lie between LOW and HIGH (0-127).

MIN, MAX are angles from -100.0 degrees to +100.0 degrees, where a level
hand position corresponds to 0.0 degrees. As your hand tilts between MIN and
MAX, controller output varies continuously between LOW and HIGH.


Configuring roll
----------------

Roll is activated by rolling your hand to the left or right. The controller
or pitch deflection varies with the angle of roll. To configure this gesture
in a slot, use

  ringctl DEVICE BANK SLOT ENABLE roll CONTROL LOW HIGH MIN MAX

ENABLE sets the initial state of the gesture: 0 if disabled or 1 if enabled.
It can later be toggled on and off with the corresponding hub button, and
when enabled, the slot LED will glow turquoise to indicate roll is active.

CONTROL is the MIDI controller number (0-127) to generate, or -1 for pitch
bend. Controller output is constrained to lie between LOW and HIGH (0-127).

MIN, MAX are angles from -100.0 degrees to +100.0 degrees, where a level
hand position corresponds to 0.0 degrees. As your hand rolls between MIN and
MAX, controller output varies continuously between LOW and HIGH.


Removing a gesture
------------------

To remove the gesture from a slot, leaving it empty, use

  ringctl DEVICE BANK SLOT remove

It is not necessary to remove gestures to replace them: just overwrite them.


Storing the configuration
-------------------------

Configuration changes made using the above commands can be written to flash
in the hub using

  ringctl DEVICE store

so that they will not be lost when it is powered down.


Implementation notes
--------------------

Serial port access is inevitably ugly, but the code should be reasonably
portable between Linux and BSD-like systems. Terminal attributes are saved
before modification so they can be restored on exit.

Parameter values between -100.0 and 100.0 are encoded in the serial protocol
as 32-bit little-endian integers. The high bit represents the sign, and the
lower bits are proportional to x ** k where k is chosen such that x = 50.0
corresponds to 0x42480000, and x = 100.0 corresponds to 0x42c80000. See the
definitions of encode() and decode() in the ringctl script for details.

Unfortunately, protocol messages are neither framed nor encode their own
length, so we can only assume the expected number of bytes follow a given
message header. This will be fragile as the protocol evolves.
